<p>These exercises exclude the coding projects, which I will write about later and post on GitHub.</p>
<p>Answering these has been very tedious. The first few were easy, but they quickly ballooned in difficulty / time required and so they got put on the back burner for a bit. I hope this book becomes more enjoyable.</p>
<h1 id="21">2.1</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The highest-degree term in <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x^2\)</span>; the highest-degree term in <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. The highest possible power of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> that can occur in <span class="math">\(f \cdot g\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x^2 \cdot x\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(x^3\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The highest-degree term in <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x^n\)</span>; the highest-degree term in <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is <span class="math">\(m\)</span>. The highest possible power of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> that can occur in <span class="math">\(f \cdot g\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x^n \cdot x^m = x^{n + m}\)</span>, resulting in a polynomial of degree <span class="math">\(n+m\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This does not hold when <span class="math">\(f\)</span> or <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are the zero polynomial. The generalization could be changed to say that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span> are polynomials with degrees <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m\)</span> where <span class="math">\(n \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m \geq 0\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="22">2.2</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n = 24\)</span>, then the relative prime numbers of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are <span class="math">\(5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\)</span>, which means <span class="math">\(\phi(n) = 8\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One example of a monic polynomial is <span class="math">\(f(x) = x^5 + 3x^4 + 12x^3 + x + 7\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f(x) = 6x^3 + 18x^2 - 3x\)</span>, a <span class="math">\(3x\)</span> can be factored out of each term, leaving the factors <span class="math">\(g(x) = 2x^3 + 6x^2 - 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h(x) = 3x\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="math">\(f(x) = 17x^3 - 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(x) = 6x^2\)</span> are relatively prime polynomials. <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is also irreducible. For the functions <span class="math">\(f(x) = 2x^2 + 4\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(x) = 4x^2 + 8\)</span>, their greatest common divisor, since it must be monic, is <span class="math">\((j)x = x^2 + 4\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="23">2.3</h1>
<p>According to Euler’s theorem, <span class="math">\(a^{\varphi(n)}\over{n}\)</span> has remainder <span class="math">\(1\)</span> (or <span class="math">\(a^{\varphi(n)}\)</span> <code class="highlight">mod</code> <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>). This means that
    </p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
    a^{\varphi(n)} \bmod n &amp;= 1 \\
    \frac{a^{\varphi(n)}}{n} &amp;= c + \frac{1}{n} \\
    a^{\varphi(n)} &amp;= cn + 1 \\
    \end{aligned}$$</div>
<p>
<span class="math">\(c\)</span> must be a nonnegative integer, which means that <span class="math">\(\frac{a^{\varphi(n)} - 1}{n}\)</span> must be a nonnegative integer. Using the numbers from the previous example (<span class="math">\(n = 24\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\varphi(n) = 8\)</span>), we can let <span class="math">\(a = 5\)</span>.
    </p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
    \frac{5^{8}}{24} &amp;= c + \frac{1}{24} \\
    5^{8} &amp;= 24c + 1 \\
    390625 - 1 &amp;= 24c \\
    c &amp;= 16276
    \end{aligned}$$</div>
<p>
  Indeed, <span class="math">\(\frac{390625 - 1}{24}\)</span> is a nonnegative integer.</p>
<h1 id="24">2.4</h1>
<p>Based on the definition, a number <span class="math">\(z\)</span> is algebraic if there is some polynomial function <span class="math">\(f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n\)</span>, where all <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> are rational, such that <span class="math">\(f(z) = 0\)</span>. <span class="math">\(\sqrt 2\)</span> is algebraic because it is the root of <span class="math">\(x^2 - 2\)</span>, which has the rational coefficients <span class="math">\(a_0 = -2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a_1 = 0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(a_2 = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>You can find this by trying to get to <span class="math">\(z\)</span> from 0, then going backwards through that order of operations starting with <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. I find this easier to visualize by writing in Clojure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sqrt</span>         <span class="c1">; x^2</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))</span>    <span class="c1">; - 2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What about <span class="math">\(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\)</span>?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">/ </span><span class="mi">2</span>              <span class="c1">; 2x</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">1</span>            <span class="c1">; - 1</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">sqrt</span>         <span class="c1">; all of that ^2</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">+ </span><span class="mi">5</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">))))</span>  <span class="c1">; - 5</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;= (2x - 1)^2 - 5 \\
&amp;= 2x^2 - 4x + 1 - 5 \\
&amp;= 2x^2 - 4x - 4
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>So, we have a polynomial. Since we started from 0 and worked in reverse to come up with this polynomial, that should mean <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is algebraic. Let’s check:</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
f(\phi) &amp;= \Big(\cancel{2}(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{\cancel{2}}) - 1\Big)^2 - 5 \\
&amp;= (\cancel{1} + \sqrt 5 - \cancel{1})^2 - 5 \\
&amp;= (\sqrt 5)^2 - 5 \\
&amp;= 0
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>And <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is its root, so yes, <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is an algebraic number. Now, how about <span class="math">\(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3\)</span>? At first I tried to work it out with Clojure and I got the wrong answer. But there is definitely a way to make <span class="math">\(\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3 = 0\)</span>. I did it the old-fashioned way, filling up an entire sheet of paper with algebra.</p>
<p>You have to square the term to get rid of the square roots, but because <span class="math">\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\)</span>, you’ll also have to get rid of the <span class="math">\(2\sqrt 2\sqrt 3\)</span> that remains when you do <span class="math">\((\sqrt 2 + \sqrt 3)^2\)</span>.</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;= \Big(\frac{x^2 - 5}{2}\Big)^2 - 6 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{5}{2}x^2 + \frac{25}{4} - 6 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4}x^4 + \frac{5}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<h1 id="25">2.5</h1>
<h2 id="product-and-sum-of-algebraic-numbers">Product and sum of algebraic numbers</h2>
<p>A polynomial encompasses the operations of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. To find the root of a polynomial is to perform the ”opposite” of these operations.</p>
<p>Addition and multiplication are commutative, so their opposite is themselves; the opposite of exponentiation is to take a root.</p>
<p>It would seem from the above work that any number made from combinations of these “opposite” operations performed on rational numbers is the root of <em>some</em> polynomial and is therefore algebraic.</p>
<p>Therefore, for any two algebraic numbers, their sum and their product are both algebraic as well.</p>
<h2 id="proof-regarding-pie-and-pi-e">Proof regarding <span class="math">\(\pi+e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span> </h2>
<p>For this part, I was stuck, so I got some help from the author himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the <span class="math">\(\pi+e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span> part, there are two steps: (1) prove that a number which is the root of a polynomial whose coefficients are algebraic is also algebraic, and (2) construct a polynomial whose roots are <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span>, and whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of <span class="math">\(\pi+e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author said the second part was easy. It is, but it’s not obvious. Apparently you can create a polynomial from a series of roots by just <a href="https://www.purplemath.com/modules/fromzero2.htm">subtracting them from <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and multiplying them together</a>:</p>
<div class="math">$$ (x-r_1)(x-r_2) $$</div>
<p>Since we want a polynomial with roots <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;= (x-\pi)(x-e) \\
&amp;= x^2 - ex - \pi x + \pi e \\
&amp;= x^2 - (\textcolor{teal}{\pi + e})x + \textcolor{orange}{\pi e}
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>Done!</p>
<p>Now, back to the first part. In a more general form, the statement about the roots of a polynomial would look like</p>
<div class="math">$$ f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^n (x-r_i) $$</div>
<p>for a polynomial with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> roots.</p>
<p>That means all that can ever happen to any <span class="math">\(r_i\)</span> is the accumulation of multiplication or addition operations.</p>
<p>As discussed above, for any two algebraic numbers, their sum and their product are both algebraic as well. So for a set of <span class="math">\(r_1, \cdots, r_n\)</span> that are all algebraic, <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> will also be algebraic.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> are known to <em>not</em> be algebraic, so accumulating multiplication or addition with algebraic numbers will never <em>make</em> them algebraic. Therefore the resulting coefficients will not be algebraic.</p>
<p>Let’s try making <span class="math">\(\pi + e\)</span> a root of a polynomial that has an <em>algebraic</em> root as well.</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
g(x) &amp;= \Big(x - (\pi + e)\Big)(x + 2) \\
&amp;= x^2 + 2x - (\pi + e)x - 2(\pi + e) \\
&amp;= x^2 + (2 - \pi - e)x - 2\pi - e
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>Nope! How about <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span>?</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
h(x) &amp;= (x - \pi e)(x + 2) \\
&amp;= x^2 + 2x - \pi e x - 2 \pi e \\
&amp;= x^2 + (2 - \pi e)x - 2 \pi e
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>Here, we cannot know for sure. If <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span> is algebraic, then <span class="math">\(h(x)\)</span> will also be algebraic. But we don’t know. So it is true that <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(e\)</span> are not algebraic, but <span class="math">\(\pi + e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\pi e\)</span> cannot <em>both</em> be algebraic.</p>
<h1 id="26">2.6</h1>
<p>I don’t know how to prove Vieta’s formulas other than working through them. The product is easier than the sum and can be done without substituting actual numbers. Let’s try a polynomial of degree 3 (<span class="math">\(n=3\)</span>):</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{gathered}
(x - r_3)(x - r_2)(x - r_1) \\
(x^2 - r_2x - r_3x + \textcolor{red}{r_2r_3})(x - r_1) \\
x^3 - r_2x^2 - r_3x^2 + r_2r_3x - (r_1x^2 + r_1r_2x + r_1r_3x - \textcolor{red}{r_1r_2r_3}) \\
x^3 \textcolor{teal}{- r_2x^2 - r_3x^2} + \textcolor{orange}{r_2r_3x} - \textcolor{teal}{r_1x^2} \textcolor{orange}{- r_1r_2x - r_1r_3x} + \textcolor{red}{r_1r_2r_3} \\
{\underbrace{\textcolor{lightgray}{1}}_{a_3}} x^3 + {\underbrace{(\textcolor{teal}{-r_1 - r_2- r_3}}_{a_2})} x^2 + {\underbrace{(\textcolor{orange}{-r_1r_2 - r_1r_3 + r_2r_3})}_{a_1}} x + \underbrace{\textcolor{red}{r_1r_2r_3}}_{a_0}
\end{gathered} $$</div>
<p>According to Vieta’s formula, the following should be true:</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
\prod_{i=1}^n r_i &amp;= (-1)^n \frac{a_0}{a_n} \\
r_1r_2r_3 &amp;\overset{?}{=} (-1)^3 \frac{r_1r_2r_3}{1} \end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>Indeed it is! And if you look at the term I went back and highlighted in red above, you can see why:</p>
<p>As you keep multiplying binomials, the final coefficient (the one without a variable) is always going to be the cumulative product of the roots (the term in the binomials without a variable), with the sign switching for each binomial you multiply.</p>
<p>But what about the sum of the roots?</p>
<div class="math">$$ \begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=1}^n r_i &amp;= -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \\
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 &amp;\overset{?}{=} -\frac{a_2}{a_3} \\
&amp;\overset{?}{=} -\frac{-r_1 - r_2 - r_3}{1} \\
&amp;= r_1 + r_2 + r_3
\end{aligned} $$</div>
<p>I can’t explain why this is the case, but I can see that it does work.</p>
<p>So Vieta’s formulas are basically saying that for any degree <span class="math">\(n\)</span> polynomial <span class="math">\(a_n \prod_{i=1}^n (x - r_i)\)</span> with roots <span class="math">\(r_1, ..., r_n\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> acts to “scale” the polynomial, then</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(a_0\)</span> (the coefficient without a variable) is the de-scaled product of all the roots (flipping its sign for each iteration), and</li>
<li><span class="math">\(a_{n-1}\)</span>, the coefficient of the second highest term, is the flipped-sign de-scaled sum of all the roots.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="29">2.9</h1>
<p>Wilkinson’s polynomial has a very precise shape because it was created from multiplying very simple binomials. It is “infinitely” steep near its roots (almost a straight line) and because the terms are of such a high order, altering the coefficients slightly turns what was a very “simple” function (the product of simple binomials) into an extremely complicated one.</p>
<h1 id="212">2.12</h1>
<p>As far as I found, fields of math involved in different proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra include: Complex analysis, real analysis, topology, and Riemannian differential geometry. Pretty scary stuff.</p>
